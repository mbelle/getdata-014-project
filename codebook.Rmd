##Original Data set descriptions

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'



##The steps to produce the output file are as follows:
* check if data exisits, if not, load data file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip then unzip file. If data exisits then this is skipped.
* load dplyr - this will create a warning but will not stop execution of code
* load subject data,load test data (y is activity x is variable measurement data)
* load train data y is activity x is variable data
* create tables with subject, activity, readings by cbind in order
* rbind the training and the test sets to create one data set. Merge is not used because it can change the order of data
* Instructions are "Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement." To do this, Look for columns names containing either "-mean" or "-std." Then create vector index of the mean/std columns 
* adjust the indexes for the position of the actual dataset adding the columns for subject and activity
* include selected columns for mean/std and the first two columns (subject and activity)
* Instructions are "Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names."  To do this,set the column names based on the description of the dataset in the features.txt file. Note: These are not entirely friendly but because they are well documented I believe this are appropriately descriptive.
* subset by the vector of selected columns (a) and create a new df
* Instructions are "From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject." I understand this to mean group by subject and activity then calculate mean values. I do so using "group_by" and "summarise each"
* "Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set" I do so by setting factor levels and labels for activity.
* write final results to table "output.txt"
