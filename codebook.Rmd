The steps to produce the output file are as follows:
-check if data exisits, if not, load data file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
-unzip file
-load dplyr - this will create a warning but will not stop execution of code
-load subject data,load test data (y is activity x is variable measurement data)
-load train data y is activity x is variable data
-create tables with subject, activity, readings by cbind in order
-rbind the training and the test sets to create one data set. Merge is not used because it can change the order of data
-Instructions are "Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement." To do this, Look for columns names containing either "-mean" or "-std." Then create vector index of the mean/std columns 
-adjust the indexes for the position of the actual dataset adding the columns for subject and activity
-include selected columns for mean/std and the first two columns (subject and activity)
-Instructions are "Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names."  To do this,set the column names based on the description of the dataset in the features.txt file. Note: These are not entirely friendly but because they are well documented I believe this are appropriately descriptive.
-subset by the vector of selected columns (a) and create a new df
-Instructions are "From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject." I understand this to mean group by subject and activity then calculate mean values. I do so using "group_by" and "summarise each"
-"Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set" I do so by setting factor levels and labels for activity.
- write final results to table "output.txt"  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
