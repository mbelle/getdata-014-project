##The steps to produce the output file are as follows:
* check if data exisits, if not, load data file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip then unzip file. If data exisits then this is skipped.
* load dplyr - this will create a warning but will not stop execution of code
* load subject data,load test data (y is activity x is variable measurement data)
* load train data y is activity x is variable data
* create tables with subject, activity, readings by cbind in order
* rbind the training and the test sets to create one data set. Merge is not used because it can change the order of data
* Instructions are "Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement." To do this, Look for columns names containing either "-mean" or "-std." Then create vector index of the mean/std columns 
* adjust the indexes for the position of the actual dataset adding the columns for subject and activity
* include selected columns for mean/std and the first two columns (subject and activity)
* Instructions are "Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names."  To do this,set the column names based on the description of the dataset in the features.txt file. Note: These are not entirely friendly but because they are well documented I believe this are appropriately descriptive.
* subset by the vector of selected columns (a) and create a new df
* Instructions are "From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject." I understand this to mean group by subject and activity then calculate mean values. I do so using "group_by" and "summarise each"
* "Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set" I do so by setting factor levels and labels for activity.
* write final results to table "output.txt"
